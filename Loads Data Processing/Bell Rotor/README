PROCESSES STREAMING DATA AND MEAN DATA FILE, (CHECKS CORRELATION OF DATA
FOR ERRORS IN RECODING (MOTOR BUMPS) - on going), WRITES TO XLXS FILE

** CONFIGURED FOR ELECTRIC DRIVE LABVIEW CSV FILES **
RUN
    ProcMisc.mat
    
INPUTS
    directory         -> location of streaming data files + corresponding mean data files 
                       mean data files only required for writing to xlxs file
    conditons = [Temperature [F], % Humidity, Pressure[in-Hg]]
    Nblade    = 2 or 4
    flip      = true  -> inner load cell in same oriendtation as outer load cell
              = false -> inner load cell is flipped with reference to outer load cell (small axial spacings)
    filename          -> xlxs file name to write data to
    write_directory   -> location to write xlsx file to

OUTPUTS
    MeanData          -> structure containing each mean data file
    StreamData        -> structure containing info from streaming data
                         files; each cell = one mean data file
    SortedData        -> structure containing streaming data sorted into matrices;
                         each cell = one mean data file; each row matrix = one revolution
                         calculates ct/sigma,cp/sigma, and FM's
    RevData           -> cells containg structure of azimuthally averaged data 
                         1 cell for each data set
                         each cell contains avg and err for each variable in RevData
    AvgData           -> single cell containing avgerage and error of
                         each calculated variale in single streaming data file
    XLSX FILE         -> with given file name, compiles data from AvgData
                         and test conditions (colelctive, index angle, axial spacing) 
                         from MeanData
