This folder contains MATLAB simulink models of the LaunchPoint electric motor controller. The model predicts the coupled dynamics of the rotor-motor system by utilizing FOC and BEMT.

Files:
...speedChange -- performs a constant collective speed change with rotor sync NOT enabled.
...angleChange -- performs an index angle change under constant collective and constant speed.
...torqueCmd -- performs a torque-controlled command where the motor simply uses the current controller and not the speed nor position controllers.
